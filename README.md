# Career-Aspirants-of-GenZ

I worked on analyzing Generation Z's career aspirations using data analysis, surveys, and interactive dashboards 📊. This project provided insights into the preferences and challenges Gen Z faces in the workplace.

Project Highlights 🚀

Problem Definition: I used the 5W1H framework to understand the challenges Gen Z faces in their careers 🧠. This structured approach guided the project.

Data Collection: I designed a Google Forms survey with 25+ questions 📋, gathering insights on learning preferences, management styles, and mission alignment. This survey captured Gen Z’s career expectations.

Data Cleaning: Cleaned and standardized the data 🧹, addressing missing values, formatting inconsistencies, and splitting multi-response cells for structured data 📂.

Pivot Table Analysis: Using Excel 📊, I created pivot tables to answer 19 business questions, focusing on areas like job roles, learning opportunities, and work environments. The data for India 🌍 provided regional insights.

SQL Queries: I wrote SQL queries to extract deeper insights, using joins and aggregates 🔍 to analyze management preferences and work-life balance.

Interactive Dashboards 📈

The core component of my project was building interactive dashboards to make insights accessible to stakeholders.

Executive Dashboard: A high-level dashboard featuring slicers, bar charts, and KPIs 📊. It allowed executives to interact with data dynamically and filter insights based on specific criteria like job role or region.

Functional Dashboards: I developed three functional dashboards focused on:

Learning Aspirations Dashboard 📚: Showed how Gen Z prefers to develop skills.

Manager Aspirations Dashboard 🧑‍💼: Analyzed leadership styles Gen Z values.

Mission Aspirations Dashboard 🌟: Explored the importance of company mission alignment for Gen Z.

Each dashboard used slicers, interactive charts, and visuals to ensure intuitive data exploration 📊.

The project helped me sharpen my data analysis and presentation skills. I’m excited to apply these skills in future projects, contributing to impactful, data-driven solutions.
